# Bit Brawlers Grass Grind
 This repository contains all the assets, scripts, and packages used to develop the mobile game "Grass Grind" in Unity.
My contributions to this project were of using the unity engine to create special effects for the game levels, creating collisons and the star award system for the levels and helped in designing 2 levels.
